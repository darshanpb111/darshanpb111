PI-8 Learning Week plans:

# 📱 React Native Mobile Architecture – 2-Week Learning Plan

## 🎯 Objective
Build strong foundational knowledge and hands-on experience with mobile architecture patterns in React Native including modular structure, navigation, state management, DI, testing, and CI/CD.

---

## 📅 Week 1: Foundations of Mobile Architecture

### ✅ Day 1: Introduction to Mobile Architecture
- Understand Clean Architecture, MVVM, MVC, MVI
- Map architecture principles to React Native
- 📚 Resources:
  - [Clean Architecture in React Native – YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=react+native+clean+architecture)
- 📝 Task: Summarize Clean Architecture in your own words

---

### ✅ Day 2: Project Structure & Modularization
- Explore modular project structures (`/features`, `/core`, `/shared`, etc.)
- 📚 Resource: [Modular React Native Architecture](https://medium.com/@AlexMiranda/modular-react-native-architecture-1dfc6bcf4d84)
- 🛠️ Task: Set up a sample React Native project with a modular structure

---

### ✅ Day 3: Navigation Architecture
- Deep dive into React Navigation (stack, tab, drawer)
- Learn how to structure navigation for authenticated vs. unauthenticated flows
- 🛠️ Task: Implement stack + tab navigation with authentication flow

---

### ✅ Day 4: State Management Patterns
- Compare Redux, Context API, Zustand, MobX
- 📚 Resource: [State Management in React Native](https://blog.logrocket.com/react-native-state-management-comparison/)
- 🛠️ Task: Implement Context + Reducer pattern and compare with Redux

---

### ✅ Day 5: Dependency Injection & Services Layer
- Understand the purpose of services, repositories, and use cases
- Explore simple DI approaches or libraries like `inversify`
- 🛠️ Task: Create a `UserService` and inject it into a feature

---

### 📌 Weekend Challenge
Build a basic **Notes App** with layered architecture:



---

## 📅 Week 2: Real-World Application & Advanced Concepts

### ✅ Day 6: Testing Architecture
- Learn about unit, integration, and e2e testing
- Tools: Jest, React Native Testing Library
- 🛠️ Task: Write unit tests for a service and a screen component

---

### ✅ Day 7: Offline-First Architecture
- Explore AsyncStorage, SQLite, and react-query for caching
- 🛠️ Task: Cache notes locally using react-query + AsyncStorage

---

### ✅ Day 8: Error Handling & Logging
- Centralize error boundaries and integrate crash reporting
- Tools: Sentry, Reactotron
- 🛠️ Task: Add a global error handler + Sentry integration

---

### ✅ Day 9: Clean Code & Linting
- Learn clean code practices in RN
- Setup ESLint, Prettier, and Husky
- 🛠️ Task: Refactor a feature module using clean architecture principles

---

### ✅ Day 10: CI/CD Pipeline Setup
- Learn basics of CI/CD in mobile using GitHub Actions, EAS, or Bitrise
- 🛠️ Task: Setup a GitHub Action to lint and run tests on pull request

---

### 📌 Final Weekend Capstone Project
Extend your **Notes App** to include:
- ✅ Offline support
- ✅ Error logging (Sentry or fallback)
- ✅ Modular folder structure
- ✅ Unit tests for at least 2 modules
- ✅ Basic CI pipeline with lint/test check

---
